Python shared clipboard class
=============================

The `shared_clipboard .clipboard.Clipboard` Python class provides a means
to get/set/clear a remote clipboard stored in
[Fluidinfo](http://fluidinfo.com/).

Setting up
----------

To use the class, [create a Fluidinfo
account](https://fluidinfo.com/accounts/new/) and put your username and
password into the top of `shared_clipboard/clipboard.py`.

This could obviously be done more securely!

See the file `INSTALL.markdown` for installation instructions.
