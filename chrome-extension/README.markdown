Installation and use
====================

To use the Chrome extension, [create a Fluidinfo
account](https://fluidinfo.com/accounts/new/) and put your username and
password into the top of `background.js`.

For now you'll need to install the this as an unpacked extension in
Chrome. Visit `chrome://extensions`, turn on Developer Mode, and click
`Load unpacked extension`. Then navigate to the directory of this extension
and Chrome will do the rest.

When in a text area in Chrome, you'll see a context menu that gives you the
option of saving your selected text (if you have anything selected),
inserting the remote clipboard, or clearing the clipboard.
